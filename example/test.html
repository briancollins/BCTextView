		<b>Intel G2 TRIM Firmware Update Status - 12/01/2009</b> <br/><br/>&#13;
Intel has released a new firmware (02HD) and firmware update tool (version 1.5) to fix the issue with the firmware update process on 34nm (G2) Intel® X25-M SSDs (80GB and 160GB).<br/><br/>&#13;
Intel recommends that end users <a href="http://downloadcenter.intel.com/Detail_Desc.aspx?agr=Y&amp;DwnldID=18363" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Download</a> this firmware update tool and upgrade your SSD<br/><br/>&#13;
* This new firmware provides TRIM support (on 80GB and 160GB G2 34nm drives) and better sequential write performance (write speed increased to 100 MB/s on 160GB drives)<br/><br/>&#13;

The top, in order of what's considered best, by consumer level performance/support first:<br/><br/>&#13;
1.) Intel X-18/X-25M Line (Intel Controller) Comes in 40 GB (sold by Kingston), 80 GB and 160 GB capacities. Generation 2 drives introduced TRIM support. Kingston also sells re-badged versions of 80 GB and 160 GB drives.<br/>&#13;
2.) OCZ Vertex (Indilinx Barefoot Controller) Comes in 30GB, 60GB, and 120GB capacities.<br/>&#13;
3.) OCZ Agility (Indilinx Barefoot Controller) Comes in 30GB, 60GB, and 120GB capacities.<br/>&#13;
4.) All other Indilinx Barefoot Controller based SSDs<br/><br/><b>Are there any SSDs I should avoid? :</b><br/><br/>&#13;
Avoid JMicron controller based SSDs, older generation drives had major stuttering issues. Newer ones are better but still have crappy comparative performance (though still much faster than a mechanical hard drive). <br/><br/>&#13;
OCZ has more than just the Vertex and Agility lines of SSDs, but those are the only ones you want. Don't buy Vertex or Agility EX disks, they're just overclocked regular SSDs at a higher price, for little performance increase. Don't buy the Apex or Solid lines of SSDs as they are based on the inferior JMicron controller. <br/><br/>&#13;
Avoid buying SSD with new computers. In addition to the premium you'll probably pay for getting it installed by the manufacturer most of them use Samsung SSD's, they used to be second only to Intels, but the Indilinx drives are now superior. More importantly though, Samsungs don't have a user updateable firmware, it has to be sent back to Samsung (even if they were sold by another company such as Corsair or OCZ). It's much better to buy the computer and then put in a Intel or (Indilinx) OCZ. <br/><br/><b>WARNING IF YOU HAVE A PRE-UNIBODY MACBOOK PRO</b><br/><br/>&#13;
Beware the Indilinx drives if you are using a pre-unibody macbook pro, many (especially early 2008 MBPs) can't use bootcamp or flash the drive. Basically, booting anything that is not OSX on an affected machine will cause the system to hang. It's especially annoying because in order to flash the firmware you have to take the drive out and put it in a PC. <br/><br/>&#13;

Because of shortage of Intel SSDs, and price gouging hikes because of the shortage, the OCZ Agility is considered the current best overall value. Once the Intel drive prices come back to normal the best value drive is the one with the capacity closest to what you wish to get. Want a 30GB or 60 GB drive? OCZ. 80 GB? Intel. 120 GB? OCZ. 160 GB? Intel. <br/><br/>&#13;
All Indilinx Barefoot controllers of the same spec perform about the same, but with OCZ you get bleeding edge firmware updates, features and support. The Agility is identical to the Vertex with slightly slower memory, they get firmware updates at about the same time.<br/><br/><b>What are the choices for cheap SSDs?</b><br/><br/>&#13;
If speed isn't your top concern (such as an SSD for a netbook), but you'd like the other benefits SSDs provide, consider these models:<br/><br/>&#13;
Kingston 64GB or 128GB SSDNow V Series - Can be had for $110 or $210 respectively. Based on the JMicron 2nd generation chipset, so no stuttering issues, but it's not a speed demon either. <br/><br/>&#13;

Kingston 40GB V Series Boot Drive - Can be had for around $100.  Based on the 34nm Intel G2, with half the sequential write speed of a 80gb G2. The Kingston drive is currently not compatible with the Intel TRIM firmware update or the Intel SSD Toolbox and Optimizer.<br/><br/>&#13;

Make sure you have "enough" memory for your computer first. Memory is cheap and if you don't have enough installed it will be an unnecessary source of slow performance. Check the physical RAM usage to make sure your memory usage isn't higher than the amount of RAM you have installed. There's no reason to not to run with at least 2GB of memory on Vista+, and with at least 4GB+ if you do any gaming / 64 bit computing. <br/><br/>&#13;
Get the right upgrade for the right slowdown. If the tasks you're concerned about are severely CPU bound get a a better CPU. Regardless, moving to decent SSD from a mechanical hard disk will give a noticeable speed boost for many tasks (see the what will / will not be faster with an SSD section below). <br/><br/><b>What will be faster with an SSD compared to a mechanical hard disk?</b><br/><br/>&#13;
Modern SSDs excel at random reads since seek times are virtually 0. The better modern SSDs also have excellent read and very good sequential write performance. In summary, anything that's I/O bound will be much faster with an SSD, this includes:<br/>&#13;
* Booting<br/>&#13;
* Closing/Opening applications <br/>&#13;
* Loading game levels<br/>&#13;
* Loading/Booting virtual machines<br/><br/><b>What will not be faster with an SSD?</b><br/><br/>&#13;
Anything that's not I/O bound:<br/>&#13;
* DVD encoding (CPU bound)<br/>&#13;
* Game frame rates (CPU/GPU bound)<br/>&#13;
* Video file frame rates (CPU/GPU bound)<br/><br/><b>I heard SSDs have a limited write lifetime since they're flash based, how long will an SSD last?</b><br/><br/>&#13;
Enterprise priced SLC based SSDs have much higher lifetime than consumer priced MLC based SSDs. <br/><br/>&#13;
SLC vs MLC lifetime, unless you're a business that's constantly writing to the drive, is mostly a non issue. With modern wear leveling techniques on MLC drives such as from Intel line is capable of writing 100gb of data a day for at least 5 years. Way before that happens you'll want to replace the drive with a bigger, faster, and cheaper SSD.<br/><br/>&#13;
SSD failure due to write wear is not like a mechanical disk failure. With a mechanical disk failure it's bye bye data. Mechanical drives that are constantly used tend to fail way sooner than 5 years on average anyway because of mechanical wear and abuse. When a SSD fails because of write usage it simply can't do anymore writes, but it can still do reads. Also Intel plans to release a tool to monitor your drive SMART data and warn if you're getting close to your write threshold. With SLC drive costing on average 2x+ more than an MLC counterpart it's more beneficial on the consumer level to just replace the drive with a cheaper/bigger drive than to keep around an older drive for longer.<br/><br/><br/><b>Can I run chkdsk on a SSD, can I run a disk clone tool on one?</b><br/><br/>&#13;
Sure, as far as your computer is concerned an SSD as just like any other connected storage device. Acronis, Norton Ghost, and dd have been verified to work just fine on SSDs. <br/><br/>&#13;
Be careful when restoring an image from a different drive to ensure you get the right 512k or 1024k partition offset, otherwise there could be a significant degradation in performance.  Windows 7 will align the partition automatically on initial install of new raw drive, but when you're imaging from different source you have to tell the software to do it manually. The reason is that if you have an oddball partition offset number then the drive is actually trying to read/write 2 blocks for what is effectively one block's worth of information, you can imagine how that's a bad thing. XP I think does 32kb alignment offset which, while it lines up to 4kb sectors, does not line up to 512kb blocks, so people on the OCZ forums started recommending 64kb or 128kb. Vista and 7 both align every partition, whether on a platter or solid state drive, to 1024kb. Older versions of software like Acronis or Norton Ghost tend to use I think 32kb or 64kb.<br/><br/>&#13;
You can read more about partition alignment here:<br/><a href="http://www.ocztechnologyforum.com/forum/showthread.php?t=48309" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.ocztechnologyforum.com/f...ead.php?t=48309</a><br/><br/><u><b>Mobile Laptop/Netbook Considerations</b></u><br/>&#13;
Something to watch out for when putting a SSD into an laptop is that any laptop based on an older onboard controller (older than ICH8) is probably capped at SATA-150, even if the laptop motherboard chipset says it has SATA-300 (aka SATA II) support. The result is that on mobile platforms the SATA controller the limiting factor in read speeds of some of the better SSDs (such as OCZ Vertex and Intel X25 series). Although this results in possibly slower speed than the full potential of the drive in many cases it's still many times faster than a mechanical hard disk.<br/><br/>&#13;

The most common read/write usage pattern for most users tends to be small random reads/writes, not sequentially copying large files, if it is for you then a SSD might not be the best choice. When examining an SSD for purchase pay attention the speed of the small (4k) random write performance specification to have an accurate picture of what will give the best overall performance. That's why the Intel drives are considered the performance king. Pretty much every other SSD in the same price category as the Intel SSD has 2x-3x faster sequential write speeds, but the Intel whips every other SSD's ass in 4k random writes, which falls into the most common usage pattern.<br/><br/><b>How can I tell if a drive is a Generation 1 (G1) or Generation 2 (G2) Intel SSD?</b><br/><br/>&#13;

Much like rotational hard drives SSDs don't bother to clear out data the OS has marked deleted, instead they clear it off when they need to write something new to it. However unlike a mechanical hard disk this is not a single pass operation and so SSD's take a significant performance penalty for writes once the drive has filled up and there's no clean empty space to write to. This is one of two major issues discovered with first generation SSD's in early 2009. An OS with TRIM support tells the SSD to mark the cell as deleted at the time deletion. <br/><br/>&#13;

You'll need explicit operating system, drive firmware, and operating system SATA/IDE driver that supports TRIM. If you're using a RAID controller you'll also need a RAID controller and drivers that support TRIM (no RAID controllers currently support TRIM). <br/><br/><b>Which drives support TRIM?</b><br/><br/>&#13;
Intel 34nm Generation 2 drives (X-18M G2, X-25M G2, currently not the 34nm Intel based 40GB Kingston) as of firmware released 10/26/2009.<br/><br/>&#13;
Indilinx based Barefoot SSDs. This includes OCZ Vertex, OCZ Agility, G.Skill Falcon, Patriot Torx, Crucial M225, and the Super Talent UltraDrive. The Indilinx drives listed above support TRIM as of firmware version 1.4, Crucial and Super Talent number their TRIM supported firmware as 1819. <br/><br/>&#13;
It's also been reported that the Samsung based Corsair says P SSD will also soon sport a TRIM update.<br/><br/><b>What's the status of TRIM support on Windows?</b><br/><br/>&#13;
Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 (same Kernel) have support for the TRIM command. Older Windows operating systems do not support TRIM, with no current plans to add support to older Windows versions. In Windows 7, for now, it's recommended to use Microsoft's AHCI driver, as the Intel Matrix driver doesn't support TRIM:<br/><img src="http://img.waffleimages.com/2073bad46da8702fe53adc4a164ba2aeaeedacff/intel_matrix_trim_support2.png" alt="" class="img" border="0"/><br/><br/>&#13;

    <b>Jeff Layton</b> Is there any thought being given to adapting ext4 to SSDs? If so, what concepts are being thrown around?<br/><br/><b>Theodore Tso:</b> Ive actually written a whole series of blog posts on this subject, which you can see here.<br/><br/>&#13;
    Part of the problem right now is that SSDs are still under going major changes. For example, if you are using Intels new SSDs, the X25-M and X25-E, pretty much no changes seem to be necessary.<br/><br/>&#13;
    Ext4 has support for the ATA TRIM command, which allows filesystems to inform SSDs that blocks have been deleted and do not need to be taken into account by the SSDs garbage collection and wear-leveling algorithms. Unfortunately the ATA TRIM command hasnt been finalized yet, and so (as of today) there are no drives, including Intels SSDs that actually support the ATA TRIM command; and for this reason Linuxs block device layer does not currently issue the ATA TRIM command, since there havent been any devices to test the command. So at the moment, ext4 informs the block layer that blocks that belong to deleted files can be discard, so once TRIM-capable SSDs become available, and the Linux block layer actually sends the TRIM command to the hard drives, everything will be all set to go.<br/><br/>&#13;
    However, even without TRIM support, the X25-M SSD works very well on ext4 today. I have one installed in my laptop, and it works just fine. Unfortunately, older SSDs do not work so well on ext2/3/4. It will be interesting to see how well the next generation of SSDs work on ext4. For example, I expect SanDisk and OCZ to both release new SSDs fairly soon. Both of these SSD manufacturers havent stated how their new SSDs will compare to Intels SSD offerings, but hopefully they will have comparable features. If so, it may not be worth it to try to optimize ext4 for legacy SSDs. Time will tell

Secure erase the entire drive. Secure erase is a special ATA command this is equivalent to wiping the entire drive and doing a TRIM on all the contents, which restores the drive back to factory default write performance. The main way to do this for the Intel drives is to use the <a href="http://www.pcper.com/article.php?aid=691&amp;type=expert&amp;pid=9" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">HDDErase</a> utility. However, hardware support for HDDErase is pretty mediocre. Another alternative is the use the Unix <a href="http://ata.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/ATA_Secure_Erase" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">hdparm</a> tool which can be run from a LiveCD/USB flash drive. <br/><br/><br/><u><b>Tweak FAQ</b></u><br/><br/>&#13;
When tweaking, be aware what a tweak actually improves. A lot of tweaks published for older SSDs such as the JMicron based drives were based around the fact that those drives had abysmal write performance compared to a mechanical drive. So the tweaks focused on minimizing writes to increase performance, on modern drives the opposite is true, and thus applying these tweaks would have the opposite effect. <br/><br/>&#13;
Other tweaks that minimize writes are geared towards increasing drive lifetime rather than increasing performance. A lot of tweaks published out there that minimize read/writes by disabling things like indexing or system restore increase performance regardless if you're using an SSD or not, since there's simply less background I/O happening. <br/><br/>&#13;
Turning off anything that caches to RAM can still faster when using the cache since RAM is still much faster than SSDs. Turning off things like indexing will increase overall performance at the sacrifice of performance when using something that can use the index such as a file search. <br/><br/><b>What are good SSD benchmarking tools?</b><br/><br/><a href="http://www.techpowerup.com/downloads/1137/ATTO_Disk_Benchmark_v2.34.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Atto</a><br/><a href="http://crystalmark.info/software/CrystalDiskMark/index-e.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CrystalDiskMark</a><br/><a href="http://www.simplisoftware.com/Public/index.php?request=HdTach" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">HDTach</a><br/><a href="http://www.hdtune.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">HD Tune</a><br/><a href="http://forums.legitreviews.com/about21729.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">AS SSD</a><br/><br/><b>Enable AHCI:</b><br/><br/>&#13;
Make sure to set, if available, your SATA controller to AHCI mode before installing your operating system. AHCI offers numerous noticeable performance improvements over legacy IDE mode, including NCQ support (which the Intel SSDs support). You may have to pre-load AHCI SATA controller drivers on a flash/floppy disk for the operating system installation to recognize your drive. <br/><br/>&#13;
It's also possible to put your drive in AHCI mode post installation:<br/><br/>&#13;
* In OSX and Ubuntu this usually requires no change <br/><br/>&#13;
* In Windows Vista/Windows 7 you can enable AHCI via a <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/922976" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">registry change</a>. <br/><br/>&#13;
In Windows 7, for now, it's recommended to use Microsoft's AHCI driver, as the Intel Matrix driver doesn't support TRIM.<br/><br/>&#13;
* In Windows XP, it's a trickier process since if the driver in use is a not an AHCI driver and it attempts to boot in AHCI mode a blue screen will occur and vice versa. The procedure involves installing the AHCI driver for your SATA controller first, then restart and go immediately into the BIOS to change to AHCI mode then boot normally into Windows XP. <br/><br/>&#13;

Defragging's purpose is to decrease seek time by placing related files physically contiguous to each other.<br/><br/><b>Why this is a good for a mechanical hard disk:</b><br/><br/>&#13;
A mechanical hard disk has a read head that physically spins a platter to seek to various data locations on the disk. If related files are physically next to each other less spinning (seeking) needs to be done to reach the next data location, leading to faster performance.<br/><br/><b>Why defragging doesn't increase performance on a SSD:</b><br/><br/>&#13;
One of the reasons SSDs are so fast is they have near instant seeks because instead of using a head/platter to spin/locate a data location it just accesses memory location by address. On a SSD accessing one data location is just as fast as accessing any other location (assuming the entire SSD all the NAND across the entire drive has the same specifications, which all modern SSDs do). <br/><br/><br/><b>Why defragging is bad on a SSD:</b><br/><br/>&#13;
It uses up the SSD write cycles reducing drive life time. Some defraggers run constantly in the background and can quickly kill your drive. Since a defragger is also moving files in and out of empty memory cells it has the opposite effect of TRIM, quickly degrading write performance by moving data to areas of the drive marked empty. Defragging is a very non standard write pattern and is hard to wear level, that's why it reaches the write limitation quicker. <br/><br/>&#13;
Microsoft Windows 7 detects when it's being installed on a SSD and automatically applies various changes to tweak performance on a SSD drive. One of these tweaks is to turn off the background defragger. The <a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/3292-disk-defragmenter-schedule-turn-off.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Disk Defragmenter schedule</a> (to see it go to start menu, start Disk Defragmenter) will not be turned off by default, but should have the SSD drive unselected under the choose disks settings to prevent the SSD from being defragmented when the schedule runs. Double check to make sure the SSD drive letter is unselected here.<br/><br/>&#13;

Windows 7 detects when it's being installed on an SSD and automatically sets some tweaks. Also Windows 7 introduces TRIM support. <br/><br/><div class="bbc-block"><h4>quote:</h4><blockquote>&#13;
    Other changes? When an SSD is detected, defrag, Superfetch, and Readyboost will be disabled by default. Microsoft will also disable boot and application launch prefetching on "SSDs with good random read, random write and flush performance". These were all tweaks integrated into Vista designed to improve application/boot performance with conventional hard drives. But why are these features only disabled for select SSDs? Here Microsoft provides a little more insight:<br/><br/>&#13;
    "Initially, we had configured all of these features to be off on all SSDs, but we encountered sizable performance regressions on some systems. In root causing those regressions, we found that some first generation SSDs had severe enough random write and flush problems that ultimately lead to disk reads being blocked for long periods of time. With Superfetch and other prefetching re-enabled, performance on key scenarios was markedly improved."<br/></blockquote></div>

I did a lot of reading on SSDs before I went for one and ended up with the OCZ Vertex 30 gig for less than $100. Best purchase I ever made in my life. Windows boots from the loading screen to a fully loaded desktop in about 4 seconds. There were a shitload of tweaks I did so the drive had virtually no random writes to it. Only times I write to it are when I install a program to it. I have other higher capacity drives for storing files. The lack of heat, power, and the ridiculously high increase in speed are worth the trade off for low capacity. And OCZ's support forums are amazing.<br/></blockquote></div>

For what it's worth, here's a real world "goon review" of the Vertex:<br/><br/>&#13;
We've been using SSD's as boot drives for our in-house home built file servers; we use Areca RAID controllers in RAID-6 for massive file storage, and the SSD's for the OS/Boot drives. We also started upgrading some Dev workstations with X25-M's; those are super nice but even with the price drops they are still too expensive for general use here, plus while the Devs love them to pieces they constantly bitch about the size (they all want a second one so they can RAID-0 them) - 80gb is a so-so size for a boot/application drive, at least around here.<br/><br/>&#13;
So I went looking for a decent 120gb alternative and the only one at the moment that doesn't cost a hefty premium and offers decent performance (going by synthetic benchmarks) seems to be the OCZ Vertex. Plus they have the new 1.1 firmware out which supports Trim, which will be nice when we start moving to Windows 7/2008 RC2.<br/><br/>&#13;
So in house I have:<br/><br/>&#13;
Kingston SSDNow V Series - 120gb, the "value" SSD of choice these days at $220 shipped, supposedly uses a "newer" JMicron controller that doesn't suffer from stuttering, etc.<br/><br/>&#13;
Intel X25-M, the current king of price/performance SSD's, 80gb for $330 shipped.<br/><br/>&#13;
And now, the OCZ Vertex 1VTX120G, 120gb for $320 shipped.<br/><br/>&#13;
I don't have fancy benchmarks to offer (you can get them from any of a dozen sites these days) so I'll stick with real-world impressions:<br/><br/>&#13;
The Kingstons, in everyday workstation use (I used one in mine until recently), is still 99% better than any magnetic hard drive I've used; writes seem a little slow sometimes but overall the thing boots fast, applications load with a snap, and overall system speed just seemed to go up.<br/><br/>&#13;
The X25-M's our devs are in love with, except for the size, and the fact that only a few of them have one now which means the rest of them complain to me weekly. It's hard to tell, "real world", the difference between the Kingston and it though, they are both so fast compared to normal drives. You *can*, however, tell a slight difference between my workstation and them (both X48/Intels) but really, if you didn't see them side by side daily you wouldn't know.<br/><br/>&#13;
The Vertex, however, is now my new drive of choice. Holy shit. Feels as fast as the Intels - I'd almost say faster, but of course this is just impressions and not benchmarking - and it's the same price for 40gb more.<br/><br/>&#13;
So if you really have to have one of these, I'd go with the Vertex 120. At $320 it's still a hefty premium, and they are bound to get cheaper, but considering it now has Trim support it should at least be future proofed for a while. As others have said, if you can afford it, no single upgrade will make your system faster, assuming you already have a good CPU/Memory size.<br/><br/>&#13;
The Kingston, on the other hand, would probably suit most people just fine, unless you are the type who can't stand knowing there's something faster out there. Compared to a magnetic drive it's still night and day, I only know the difference because I have now used the other two. If you want to save some bucks it's not a bad bet.<br/></blockquote></div>

I grabbed a 120GB OCZ Agility. I did a fresh install of Windows 7. The drive was shipped to me with the latest firmware.<br/><br/>&#13;
I ended up installing roughly 52GB of applications onto the drive. After that, I ran the manual TRIM utility provided by OCZ (support for Win7 TRIM is coming, supposedly).<br/><br/>&#13;
Because I did several things that increased performance (installed Win7, went to 64-bit OS so I can use all 4GB of RAM, added SSD), I can't conclusively say that the drive is completely responsible for the extreme increase in performance, but I'm fairly certain.<br/><br/><b>Time from Windows Login to Responsive GUI:</b> Old - <i>~60s</i> | New - <i>~6s</i><br/><br/>&#13;
This is with an E8400, ATI Radeon 4870, 4GB RAM, etc.<br/><br/><b>APPLICATION LAUNCHES</b><br/><br/>&#13;
These would be checked from the first load upon Windows boot, obviously -- subsequent reloads were obviously faster than cold boot.<br/><br/><i>Photoshop CS4:</i> OLD - 30s || NEW - 3s<br/><i>Civ4: Beyond the Sword:</i> OLD - 60s || NEW - 5s<br/><i>After Effects</i> CS4: OLD - 60-80s || NEW - 8s<br/><br/>&#13;
You know what the biggest change is, though? It's not the speed it takes to open an application -- it's the way the computer behaves after you close one. After playing a fairly intense game -- Half-Life 2, DoW:II, etc... -- for a bit, you can always hear the hard-drive whirring for awhile once you quit. The OS is usually laggy for a few seconds as well as the HDD continues doing whatever the fuck it's doing -- clearing temp files? I don't know.<br/><br/>&#13;
You don't get that with an SSD. You quit an application, maybe there is a second of delay for the more demanding ones, and then -- BOOM -- you are back working with a fully-responsive GUI, ready to jump right into the next application.<br/><br/>&#13;

So, I just installed my 60GB OCZ Agility drive. Before I switched over, I wiped clean my 500GB WD Caviar Black drive to run some performance tests.<br/><br/>&#13;
There are some things which are just obvious. Take, for example, starting Firefox immediately after booting the computer. Doing thins on the Caviar Black drive took up to 50 seconds, but doing so on the SSD drive brings Firefox up in two or three seconds. I'm sure this is due to the random access performance. On the Caviar Black it seemed that it needed to complete loading everything associated with boot-up before running Firefox, but the OCZ Agility allows it to come up in a snap.<br/><br/>&#13;
Boot times don't seem to be as dramatically improved, but it still seems to have shaved 10 seconds on average.<br/><br/>&#13;
Overall these results correspond to what I expected after reading Anandtech's last big SSD roundup. But one thing I should note is that the subjective performance difference is not that great when you're doing something repetitive. I'm sure that is because of Vista's aggressive cache of programs you're running. In fact I noticed that when loading games, the load times were about 25% shorter on the second load.<br/></blockquote></div>

So true. I just went from a crufty lenovo xp install on my thinkpad with a rotational drive to win7 on a vertex and the difference is huge. I don't think I could go back to the old drive.<br/><br/>&#13;
Installing language packs still took hours though, wtf. <br/></blockquote></div>

		<u><b>RAID Considerations</b></u><br/><br/><b>Will an SSD RAID 0 give me better performance?</b><br/><br/>&#13;
Yes! SSDs get practically linear performance gains in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAID_0#RAID_0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">RAID 0</a> without the random seek time loss.  <br/><br/>&#13;
Here are some videos to nerdgasm to:<br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg5DecUcatA" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg5DecUcatA</a><br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96dWOEa4Djs" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96dWOEa4Djs</a><br/><br/>&#13;
SSD Raid Review: <a href="http://hothardware.com/News/Intel-SSDs-RAID-0-A-Case-Study-In-Speed-Take-2/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://hothardware.com/News/Intel-S...n-Speed-Take-2/</a><br/><br/><b>What's the best RAID controller to use for an SSD RAID?</b><br/><br/>&#13;
If using a top tier SSD such as the Intel X-25M believe it or not the ICH10R controller built into most motherboards is considered one of the fastest solutions for SSDs right now, exceeding the speed of most hardware RAID controllers in the same configuration. Many expensive hardware RAID controllers don't work very fast or at all for SSDs. An Intel ICHR (8/9/10) RAID controller can handle a 2 drive RAID 0 setup just fine. An Intel ICH10R controller has a RAID 0 limitation of around <a href="http://www.xtremesystems.org/forums/showthread.php?t=208896" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">600-650MB/s</a>. <br/><br/>&#13;
If you need more bandwidth for a larger RAID you need to add a PCI-E SATA RAID controller card. Few controllers are verified to work well/at all with SSDs, here are a few:<br/><br/>&#13;
The best performance/value right now is the <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16816118106" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">LSI 9260-4i (4 ports)</a> or <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16816118104" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">LSI 9260-8i (8 ports)</a>:<br/><a href="http://www.ocztechnologyforum.com/forum/showthread.php?t=60466" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.ocztechnologyforum.com/f...ead.php?t=60466</a><br/><br/>&#13;
The old king was the Areca ARC-1231ML-2G PCI Express SATA II Controller card (tops out at about 850 MB/s):<br/><a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16816151033" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Produ...N82E16816151033</a><br/><br/>&#13;
LSI vs Areca Card:<br/><a href="http://www.xtremesystems.org/forums/showthread.php?t=234374" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.xtremesystems.org/forums...ad.php?t=234374</a><br/><br/>&#13;
ICH10 RAID Info: <a href="http://forum.xcpus.com/mainboards-chipsets/16286-intel-ich10r-raid-0-limitations-ssds.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://forum.xcpus.com/mainboards-c...tions-ssds.html</a><br/><br/><b>Will I Need SATA III to take advantage of an SSD RAID?</b><br/><br/>&#13;
SATA III (6 Gbit/s instead of 3 Gbit/s):<br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_ATA#SATA_6_Gbit.2Fs_.28Third_generation.29" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial...d_generation.29</a><br/><br/>&#13;
No single consumer SSD is able to bottleneck SATA 2, they're getting close, but not quite yet. The speed limitation is per port, so RAIDing isn't an issue as far as SATA 2 is concerned. Though there are overall RAID/SATA controller bandwidth limitations. <br/><br/>&#13;
As far as PCI-E SSDs, they're more of a niche. Beyond 1x PCI-E, there's also 4x, 8x, 16x, 16x 2.0 that controllers can implement if the 1x PCI-E bandwidth was a limitation. <a href="http://www.fusionio.com/ioxtreme/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fusion I/O</a> makes a "gamer consumer level" PCI-E SSD. According to their specs it costs $895 for 80gb and gives you about 520MB/s average bandwidth perf. Also, you currently can't boot off it, but they say that will be fixed in a later firmware update.<br/><br/><b>Is TRIM supported on RAID?</b><br/><br/>&#13;
For TRIM to automatically work on the fly when a file is deleted, you need support in :<br/><br/>&#13;
1.) The internal SSD drive controller (supported by Indilinx Barefoot based drives, Intel 34nm x25-M SSDs, and newer Samsung based SSDs). <br/><br/>&#13;
2.) The OS (Currently Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, and possibly soon to ext4 Linux file systems).<br/><br/>&#13;
3.) The RAID controller / RAID controller driver, which no one has announced support for.<br/><br/>&#13;
So that means there's no announced support for TRIM on any RAID setup. But the performance gain you get with RAID 0 way outweighs the write usage degradation performance loss you get without TRIM support. This is especially true on OCZ based drives that support their <a href="http://hothardware.com/News/OCZ-and-Indilinx-Collaborate-On-New-SSD-Garbage-Collection-Scheme/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">own background garbage collection like mechanism</a>. And when it comes to Intel G1 and G2 based SSDs, with their built-in wear leveling techniques their degraded 4k write performance is still faster than the TRIMed 4k write performance of an Indilinx based SSD.
